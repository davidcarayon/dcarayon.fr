    "text": "Hi üëã \nFor my first blog post ever, I wanted to share some updates regarding two tools that have quietly become quite popular in the R/Quarto INRAE community - {InraeThemes} and quarto-inrae-extension. Originally conceived as personal projects to explore R and Quarto features, these tools have found their way into various research units and collaborations.\nSeeing the growing adoption of these projects, and especially since the Quarto extension got a spot on the official Quarto website, I thought it was time to give them a bit of a facelift.\nHere‚Äôs what‚Äôs new on the latest versions:\n\nInraeThemes 3.0.0: Refining Visualization and Design üé®\nInraeThemes, my R package for ggplot themes and Bootstrap-based themes for RShiny applications, has received some updates. With a nod to INRAE branding guidelines, this release aims to enhance the visual experience for data visualization and application development. Check out the latest version on GitHub.\n\n\nQuarto-Inrae-Extension: Streamlining Document Formatting üìÑ\nThe quarto-inrae-extension has undergone some changes, evolving into a more comprehensive solution for document formatting. Offering templates for standalone documents (HTML, PDF via Typst, docx, pptx, revealJS, and beamer), as well as Quarto projects (static websites, books, and manuscripts), this extension provides users with a versatile set of tools. Explore the updates on GitHub.\nBoth of these projects are meant to be collaborative, and I welcome any suggestions or, even better, pull requests! Special thanks to those who have already contributed (S.Boutry, E. Maign√©, C. Midoux).\nAnd of course, if you are using these tools, feel free to let me know! Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have a way to monitor their usage on GitHub. Your real-life examples would be highly appreciated!\n(R-)Quarto-ly yours,\nDavid"

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Southwest France golden-sand beaches are very popular destination for bathing and other sea activities in summer. However, they are also potentially dangerous environments with increased risk of accidents in unsupervised areas, especially during the off-peak season, due to strong rip-current and shorebreak waves. Predicting and quantifying these accidents is of major importance for public communication and emergency services management. Previous work on beach risk prediction was conducted along a specific section of the coast (Gironde), using data from 2011-2017 to train a model and further predict drowning incidents based on sea and weather forecasts, which has led to the development of an alert system based on a logistic regression model used by local decision makers [1].\nMethods: In this study, we further improve this model by using new statistical methods related to machine learning, a larger dataset (2011-2022) and by including spatialization in order to propose a modelling framework that could be generalized to other coasts. We estimated drowning risk as a combination of hazard (ocean conditions) and exposure (beachgoer crowd). Several machine learning models were trained and compared using 3-day weather and sea forecasts from 2011 to 2022 as predictors along with an emergency calls database used as an outcome on the same time frame. The training set covered 188 drowning events over 1988 days while the test set covered 78 events over 663 days.\nResults: Our results show this new modeling framework is able to predict days with the highest risk of drowning events with improved accuracy on the Gironde coast: AUC = 0.9 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.91), PPV = 0.48 (95%CI 0.41 to 0.55) and NPV = 0.98 (95%CI 0.97 to 0.99).\nConclusions: This supports the development of a new alert system that will provide useful information to decision makers. However, ‚Äúall models are wrong, but some are useful‚Äù [2]. While this model could still be improved, with further feature engineering and improved data for rescues, this work also addresses the issue of identifying the right criteria to define what would actually be the ‚Äúbest‚Äù model depending on risk management policies set by decision makers."
