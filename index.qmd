My name is David Carayon and I'm a statistician / Data Scientist working at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (INRAE).

My work mainly focuses on environmental evaluation. I build evaluation methods based on composite and statistically relevant indicators and also develop tools and software associated with these methods.

My main programming langages/skills are R (tidyverse, tidymodels, shiny), Quarto/Rmarkdown, SQL and Python.
